## Define the e-mail's purpose

- Formal tone for serious issues
- Informal tone for less important e.g. Social event

---

## Tip for formal tone

- Avoid **contractions**: *`do not`* instead of *`don't`*
- Avoid using **abbreviations**
- Avoid **idiomatic languages** and **phrasal verbs**
- Even if the message is informal, it should always be clear and polite

---

## Subject line

The subject line defines and informs the destination of the e-mail the purpose. So, in order to get a well written Subject line follow the steps below.

### Sumarize the messages

- Avoid filler words
- Prepositions and articles can often be eliminated

A good exemple would be

Instead of:

1. *"Meeting about the rail project"*
2. *"We will be offering a retirement planning workshop next week"*

Can be written as:

1. *"Rail project meeting"*
2. *"Retirement planning workshop next week"*

### Dates on the subject line

If there's a deadline or specific date involved include it in the subject line, as well as having a limit for replying the e-mail.

1. *"Rail project meeting September 12"*
2. *"Travel agents conference May 3rd, 2022"*
3. *"Account incident: immediate response needed"*
4. *"New project team: reply needed by August 12th"*

### E-mail to specific person

If the e-mail relates to a specific person, include on the subject line.

1. *"Barbara Gonzales performance review"*

### If urgent actions is required

1. *"Team meeting follow-up: Reply needed"*
2. *"Emergency contacts: action required"*

> It's interesting do the opposite of this in some cases. Saying in the email' subject line that no reply is needed.

### Things to avoid

- Writting in all capital letters
- Excessive punctuation marks

---

## Greetings

The opening line of the message. It depends on wheather you know the people you are addressing or not.

> It's highly recommended that you addresss the person by name.

- You should determine what title your recipient prefers to use. E.g.
  - *Mr., Ms., Doctor...*
- For formal e-mail: `Dear`. E.g.:
  - *"Dear Mr. Jones"*
  - *"Dear Ms. `(Last Name for a woman)`"*
  - *"Dear Dr. `(Last Name for anyone with doctorate)`"*

> If you are not sure of the person's gender you should refer as *"Dear `(First Name Last Name)`"*

...

> As well as if you don't know the recipient's name you can refer as *"Dear `J(ob Title)`"*

## A group of team you don't know

When you're writting to a group of people you don't know, you can use:

- *"Dear All"*
- *"Dear `(Team Name)`"*


### Less formal greetings

- *"Hi `(First Name)`"*
- *"Good Morning `(First Name)`"*
- *"Hello `(First Name)`"*

### Rules

The greeting line is always followed by a **comma** and the next initial word is written with **capital letter**

### Social niceties

A friendly phrase to start the e-mail with. It's not necessary in all cases. E.g.:

#### Formal

- *"I hope this message finds you well."*
- *"I hope you are well."*

#### Informal

- *"Hope you're doing well."*
- *"Hope you had a nice weekend."*
- *"Hope you had fun at the concert."*
