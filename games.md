# Games configs and more

## Rocksmith 2014 Edition

I got problems when I launched the game. The sound was chopping and the game window was always minimized, even when I tried to maximize it.

### Solution

1 - Open the `.ini` file inside the game directory folder `\Steam\steamapps\common\Rocksmith2014`

2 - Set the screen resolution in the `ScreenWidth` and `ScreenHeight` parameter

3 - Set `Win32UltraLowLatencyMode` to **0** if you got audio problems.
