## Commands

### init

```batch
git init
:: Initiates a repository
```

### add

```batch
git add filename.ext
:: Stages the `filename.ext` for commit
```

> If you use a dot <kbd>.</kbd> instead of the file name, all the changes will be staged

### status

```batch
git status
:: Show the current branch status
```

### commit

``` batch
git commit -m "message to commit"
:: makes a commit with a custom message for all the staged files
```

### push

```batch
git push
:: Pushes all the commits to the [HEAD](#head) branch
```

### clone

```batch
git clone <repo url>
:: Clones the repository to the current folder
```

```batch
git clone -b [tag_name] [repository_url]
:: Clones the repository linked to the specified tag

git clone -b v1.2 https://github.com/bosko-pnap/git-project.git
:: Example

:: To download only the latest commit in the branch and reduce the download size, add the --depth 1 flag to the command.
git clone --depth 1 --branch <tag_name> <repo_url>
```

### branch

```batch
git branch development
:: Creates a new branch named developed
```

> Tip: When creating a branch _e.g._ `git branch development`, you can publish this branch with the following command: `git push --set-upstream origin development`

```batch
git checkout
:: The git checkout command switches branches or restores working tree files.
```

> It operates on files, commits, and branches. The git checkout command allows switching between multiple features in just a single repository

```batch
git checkout development -b
:: Creates a branch and directly switches to it
```

### merge

```batch
git marge development
:: Unifies two or more histories together
```

> The [HEAD](#head) should be pointing to the ramification who will receive the merged files. So if you want to merge the development branch into the main, you should do `git checkout main` and then `git merge development`

### remote

```batch
git remote
:: List of the [remote](#remote) connections you have to other repositories
```

```batch
git remote -v
:: Same as the command above, but include the URL of each connection
```

```batch
git remote add <name> <url>
:: Create a new connection to a remote repository
```

```batch
git remote rm <name>
:: Remove the connection to the remote repository called ÔºúnameÔºû
```

## Understanding the names

<details id="head">
<summary>What is <b>HEAD</b></summary>
You can imagine the HEAD as an arrow in a git graph, something like a pointer when you are programming in a low-level language like assembly. The arrow will point to the currently selected branch, thus HEAD means where we are in the project at the moment.
</details>

<details id="origin">
<summary>What is <b>origin</b></summary>
Origin is an alias for the remote repository that the project was originally cloned from.
</details>

<details id="remote">
<summary>What is <b>Remote</b></summary>
The git remote command lets you create, view, and delete connections to other repositories. Remote connections are more like bookmarks rather than direct links inside other repositories. Instead of providing real-time access to another repository, they serve as convenient names that can be used to reference a not-so-convenient URL.

</details>

<details id="upstream">
<summary>What is <b>upstream</b></summary>
Upstream refers to the original repo or a branch. For example, when you clone from Github, the remote Github repo is upstream for the cloned local copy.
</details>

## Telling git who you are

Before making commits, git might prompt a window or information that it doesn't know who is committing the staged files. So the user must provide those data:

```batch
git config --global user.email <email>
:: This command sets a global user email
```

```batch
git config --global user.name <username>
:: This command sets a global username
```

After this, if you try to publish a repository with Vscode, an authentication window will appear so that the user can log in.

## How to set the default editor to open with git

```batch
git --global editor.core <editor-here> -w
```

- _E.g._ Setting vscode as the default editor

```batch
git --global editor.core "code" -w
```
