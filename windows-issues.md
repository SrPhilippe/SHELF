## Issues with apps when using router WIFI

1. Testing packets
   - Open command prompt (cmd)
   - send a ping to any server using the flags `-f` and `-l <size>`

      ```batch
      ping google.com.br -f -l 1480
      :: where 1480 is the value in bytes

      :: RESPONSE
      Pinging google.com.br [142.250.79.3] with 1480 bytes of data:
      Packet needs to be fragmented but DF set.
      Packet needs to be fragmented but DF set.
      Packet needs to be fragmented but DF set.
      Packet needs to be fragmented but DF set.

      ::Verify interfaces MTU values
      netsh interface ipv4 show subinterfaces
      ::Change the MTU from the interfaces
      netsh interface ipv4 set subinterface <interface_index> mtu=<new_MTU_size> store=persistent
      ```

   - make this test decreasing the bytes size until the replies return TTL.
   - Take the value found and add + `28 bytes` to it (8 from ICMP packets and 20 used by the IP).
2. Change the MTU value (maximum transmission unit)
   - Access your router admin panel.
   - Find the location of MTU configuration - in my case was inside port config.
   - Change the value in bytes accordingdly to the result obtained in the test.



## Windows shortcuts

1. Run **<kbd>WIN</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd>**

- `shell:system`: Windows sytem32 folder
- `shell:common startup`: Startup programs

## Windows 10/11 Blurred apps fix

### Method 1: Change Nvidia settings (may solve for all apps)

   1. In **Nvidia Control Panel** set `Antialising - FXAA` to **Off** and hit apply.
   2. If the option above didn't work, you can also try to change the scalling mode to `No Scaling` inside **Adjust desktop size and position** and `perform scaling on` **GPU**. (make sure to mark the checkbox _Override the scalling mode set by games and programs_).

### Method 2: Registry method (may solve for all apps)

   1. Inside Windows Registry Editor navigate to `Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop`.
   2. Look for `Win8DpiScaling` and change it's value to **1**.
   3.Create a `DWORD32` named **LogPixels** (if it doesn't already exists) and set the `value` to `DECIMAL=120` DEFAULT `DECIMAL=125`.

### Method 3: Individual setting for apps

   1. Right click on the executable file from the application being blurred and go to **properties**.
   2. Navigate to tab **Compability**.
   3. In the Settings section, choose: Change high DPI settings.
   4. Check the box Override high DPI scalling behavior.
   5. Let the scalling be performed by the application.

## Run the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe)

To do this, follow these steps:

Open an elevated command prompt. To do this, do the following as your appropriate:

If you are running Windows 10, Windows 8.1 or Windows 8, first run the inbox Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) tool prior to running the System File Checker.  (If you are running Windows 7 or Windows Vista, skip to Step 3).

Type the following command, and then press Enter.  It may take several minutes for the command operation to be completed.

```bash
DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
```

Important: When you run this command, DISM uses Windows Update to provide the files that are required to fix corruptions. However, if your Windows Update client is already broken, use a running Windows installation as the repair source, or use a Windows side-by-side folder from a network share or from a removable media, such as the Windows DVD, as the source of the files. To do this, run the following command instead:

```bash
DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth /Source:C:\RepairSource\Windows /LimitAccess
```

Note: Replace the C:\RepairSource\Windows placeholder with the location of your repair source. For more information about using the DISM tool to repair Windows, reference Repair a Windows Image.

At the command prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER:

```bash
sfc /scannow
```

Not recommended - maybe only when using a good SSD

```bash
