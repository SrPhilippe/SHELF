```batch
git init
:: Initiates a repository
``` 
add

- `git add filename.ext`: Stages the `filename.ext` for commit
  - If you use a dot <kbd>.</kbd> instead of the file name, all the changes will be staged

- `git status`: Show the current branch status

- `git commit -m "commit message"`: make a commit with a custom message for all the staged files

- `git push`: Pushes all the commits to the [HEAD](#head) branch

- `git branch`: Creates a new branch

  - > Tip: When creating a branch _e.g._ `git branch development`, you can publish this branch with the following command: `git push --set-upstream origin development`

- `git checkout`: The git checkout command switches branches or restores working tree files. It operates on files, commits, and branches. The git checkout command allows switching between multiple features in just a single repository.
  - > `git checkout -b` creates a branch and directly switch to it.

- `git marge`: Unifies two or more histories together
  - > The [HEAD](#head) should be pointing to the ramification who will receive the merged files. So if you want to merge the development branch into the main, you should do `git checkout main` and then `git merge development`

- `git remote`: List of the [remote](#remote) connections you have to other repositories
  - `git remote -v`: Same as the above command, but include the URL of each connection
  - `git remote add <name> <url>`: Create a new connection to a remote repository
  - `git remote rm <name>`: Remove the connection to the remote repository called ÔºúnameÔºû

## Understanding the names

<details id="head">
<summary>What is <b>HEAD</b></summary>
You can imagine the HEAD as an arrow in a git graph, something like a pointer when you are programming in a low-level language like assembly. The arrow will point to the currently selected branch, thus HEAD means where we are in the project at the moment.
</details>

<details id="origin">
<summary>What is <b>origin</b></summary>
Origin is an alias for the remote repository that the project was originally cloned from.
</details>

<details id="remote">
<summary>What is <b>Remote</b></summary>
The git remote command lets you create, view, and delete connections to other repositories. Remote connections are more like bookmarks rather than direct links inside other repositories. Instead of providing real-time access to another repository, they serve as convenient names that can be used to reference a not-so-convenient URL.

<details id="upstream">
<summary>What is <b>upstream</b></summary>
Upstream refers to the original repo or a branch. For example, when you clone from Github, the remote Github repo is upstream for the cloned local copy.

## How to tell git who you are?

After installing git in our computer and before we can make any commits, we must tell git who we are, passing some global or local information.

- `git config --global user.email <email>` This command sets a global user email

- `git config --global user.name <username>` This command sets a global username

After this, if you try to publish a repository with vscode, an authentication window will pop up to check the credentials to start the push.

## How to set the default editor to open with git

```git
git --global editor.core <editor-here> -w
```

- _E.g._ Setting vscode as the default editor

```git
git --global editor.core "code" -w
```
