## How to tell git who you are?

After installing git in our computer and before we can make any commits, we must tell git who we are passing some global or local informations.

- `git config --global user.email` this command sets a global user email

- `git config --global user.name` this command sets a global user name

After this, if you try to publish a repository with vscode, an authentication window will pop in order to check the credentials to start the push.

## How to set the default editor to open with git

```git
git --global editor.core <editor-here> -w
```

- _E.g._ Setting vscode as the default editor

```git
git --global editor.core "code" -w
```
